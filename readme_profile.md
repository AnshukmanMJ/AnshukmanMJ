I'm a second-year Computer Science (IoT) undergraduate on a focused mission to build intelligent, end-to-end applications. I believe the best products are built at the intersection of product management, user-centric design, and deep technical engineering.

Right now, I'm executing a long-term strategic plan to master Machine Learning from the fundamentals up.
